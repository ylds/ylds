## 🚀 Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [Banking Analysis](./banking-analysis.ipynb) | Real-World Scenario
A Portuguese bank conducted a direct marketing campaign to promote term deposit subscriptions. Clients were contacted via phone, and their responses—along with demographic and historical data—were recorded for analysis.

📁 Dataset Highlights

Total contacts: 45,211 clients

Subscribed ('yes'): 5,289 (~11.7%)

Did not subscribe ('no'): 39,922 (~88.3%)

Target variable: y (binary: yes/no)

🎯 Objective
Improve the effectiveness of future campaigns by identifying which types of clients are more likely to subscribe—helping reduce unnecessary outreach and increase ROI.

🔍 Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored key variables such as age, job type, marital status, education, and previous campaign outcomes to identify trends among subscribers.

Predictive Modeling
Built machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest
Models were evaluated for accuracy, precision, and recall to identify the most effective approach.

🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

Feature Engineering & Data Cleaning

Handling Imbalanced Classes

Interpreting Model Outputs (Feature Importance, Confusion Matrix)
